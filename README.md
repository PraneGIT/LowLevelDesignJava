# LowLevelDesign in Java

Welcome to the LowLevelDesign in Java repository! This repository is a personal project aimed at improving my understanding and skills in low-level design using Java. The concepts and examples here are inspired by the [Concept and Coding](https://www.youtube.com/@ConceptandCoding) YouTube channel and the [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/) website.

Every main file includes examples/explanation of code refactoring. Each example demonstrates a common code smell and shows how to refactor it to improve the design.
